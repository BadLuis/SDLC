How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

We need to discuss this needs between the costumers, product owners and the team. During the discussion is need to know every detail of what the costumer needs and want from the program. 
Then we transform this into users stories that will be divided into sprints.  User stories have the differents needs the costumer have.  User stories will be the connection between the team and the product owner.
Users stories save time, and replace long paperwork with a more precise documentation.
